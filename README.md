# Calculator App

## Description

The Calculator App is a user-friendly tool designed with colorblindness in mind. Its motivation stems from providing an accessible and inclusive solution for users with color vision deficiencies. The app aims to solve the problem of limited accessibility in calculators by incorporating design principles that consider colorblind users. Through this project, I've gained insights into creating more inclusive applications and learned the importance of considering diverse user needs in software development.
